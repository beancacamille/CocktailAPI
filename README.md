### Sprint Goals

* [ ] Complete User Story 1 - Choose API
* [ ] Complete User Story 2 - Setup Framework Solution
* [ ] Agile documentation completed

### Sprint Review

The purpose of this sprint is to find an appropriate API to test and set up the framework. This was achieved quickly, as TheCocktailDB allows for users to GET requests whilst being free to use, meaning that more testing than expected was completed. The split in work between the two of us has meant that our work does not cause conflicts when pushing to GitHub.

### Sprint Retrospective

When using branches from the dev branch on GitHub to upload our individual updates onto the same project, we didn't encounter and problems from this sprint. Initially, when pulling updates to our local repo, some files weren't loading into the Visual Studio file, but this was solved early and we could continue our updates.

## Sprint 2

This is the final sprint and the aim is to tidy up the existing code and refactor any necessary sections. All the documentation should be completed by the end of this sprint.
