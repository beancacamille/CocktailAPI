# Cocktail API

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to deliver a test framework for the TheCocktailDB service. By working in pairs, we hope to to incorporate good collaboration using GitHub, follow the scrum model by holding regular stand-ups and reviews and work closely together to carry out tests for the service.

### Sprint Review

The purpose of this sprint is to find an appropriate API to test and set up the framework. This was achieved quickly, as TheCocktailDB allows for users to GET requests whilst being free to use, meaning that more testing than expected was completed. The split in work between the two of us has meant that our work does not cause conflicts when pushing to GitHub.

### Sprint Retrospective

When using branches from the dev branch on GitHub to upload our individual updates onto the same project, we didn't encounter and problems from this sprint. Initially, when pulling updates to our local repo, some files weren't loading into the Visual Studio file, but this was solved early and we could continue our updates.

## Sprint 2

This is the final sprint and the aim is to tidy up the existing code and refactor any necessary sections. All the documentation should be completed by the end of this sprint.

### Sprint Goals

* [ ] User Story 6 - Refactoring
* [ ] Agile documentation completed

### Sprint Review

Having completed almost all of the project in the previous sprint, this sprint was less intense, focused on the quality of the code. Some tests were altered to have more descriptive names as well as method names too. The dev branch was updated to have all other branches merged with no conflicts.

### Sprint Retrospective

The use of branches really helped merge the updates, allowing for small alterations to be made continuously. This sprint meant that we could do work at our own pace without the need for calls but still communicated about the individual work we had completed.


# Project Review

The project requirements were met so this project can be considered successful. This was the first non-individual coding project for the both of us and this helped us appreciate the collaborating features of GitHub. The use of individual branches to make changes to the dev branch meant any conflicts could be sorted and only the correct code was committed to the dev branch.

Also, working in the SCRUM framework helped us stay organised and focused, completing tasks in accordance with user stories.

# Project Retrospective

As this is the first group/team project of the course, a lot of lessons can be taken. When using the individual branches, we made regular commits with descriptive comments so we knew what each other are pushing. This helped with avoiding conflicts and saving time to alter conflicts. It also meant we could focus on different aspects of the project to increase productivity and minimises time spent on this project.

We also tried planning out all the tests before having a solid understanding of how API's operated. This meant that we knew what each other were doing and an set out an end goal for each of us. During the first sprint we called to discuss the actions we were going to take and we agreed on what API we would test quickly, but this wasn't needed for Sprint 2.

In the future, we could spend more time focusing on the user stories as this needed to be altered and more added to fit the tests we needed to run.
