# Cocktail API

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to deliver a test framework for the TheCocktailDB service. By working in pairs, we hope to to incorporate good collaboration using GitHub, follow the scrum model by holding regular stand-ups and reviews and work closely together to carry out tests for the service.

### Sprint Review

The purpose of this sprint is to find an appropriate API to test and set up the framework. This was achieved quickly, as TheCocktailDB allows for users to GET requests whilst being free to use, meaning that more testing than expected was completed. The split in work between the two of us has meant that our work does not cause conflicts when pushing to GitHub.

### Sprint Retrospective

When using branches from the dev branch on GitHub to upload our individual updates onto the same project, we didn't encounter and problems from this sprint. Initially, when pulling updates to our local repo, some files weren't loading into the Visual Studio file, but this was solved early and we could continue our updates.

## Sprint 2

This is the final sprint and the aim is to tidy up the existing code and refactor any necessary sections. All the documentation should be completed by the end of this sprint.

### Sprint Review

Having completed almost all of the project in the previous sprint, this sprint was less intense, focused on the quality of the code. Some tests were altered to have more descriptive names as well as method names too. The dev branch was updated to have all other branches merged with no conflicts.

### Sprint Retrospective 

The use of branches really helped merge the updates, allowing for small alterations to be made continuously. This sprint meant that we could do work at our own pace without the need for calls but still communicated about the individual work we had completed.
